The Hangman Rescue Mission:- Objective: Create a text-based Hangman game.

Assignment
Level: Medium You’ve just been transported into a magical kingdom where words hold the power to save or doom someone. An evil wizard has captured a poor soul; the only way to free them is by guessing the secret word. Each wrong guess brings the prisoner closer to their fate. Use your code to build this classic game and save the day! Task: Choose a word randomly from a list. Display underscores for each letter and update with correct guesses. Limit incorrect guesses to a set number. Key Concepts: Loops, conditionals, random module, lists, string manipulation.
