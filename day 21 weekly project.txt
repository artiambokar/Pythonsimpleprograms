Lets say we have a list L1 = [1, 2, 2, 3, 2, 3, 4, 5], now identify the most repetitive element in the list?

L1=[1, 2, 2, 3, 2, 3, 4, 5]
highest_count=0
frequently_occuring_element=None
for i in L1:
  count=L1.count(i)
  if count>highest_count:
    highest_count=count
    frequently_occuring_element=i
print(f"Most repetitive element in L1:{frequently_occuring_element}")
