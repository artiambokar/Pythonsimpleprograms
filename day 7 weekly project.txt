
At the start of the day you have a checklist The tasks which you were able to finish, should get added to completed_tasks The tasks which you were not able to finish, should get added to incomplete_tasks This project is about organizing your daily tasks into two categories: completed tasks and incomplete tasks. Here’s how it works: 1. At the start of the day, you create a checklist of tasks you want to accomplish. 2. At the end of the day, you review which tasks you could finish and which you couldn’t. – If a task is finished, you move it to the completed tasks list. – If a task is not finished, you move it to the incomplete tasks list. This way, by the end of each day, you’ll have a clear overview of what you completed and what still needs attention.

checklist = ['house chores', 'read book', 'attend class', 'listen music', 'learn python']
completed_tasks = []
incomplete_tasks = []
print("Review of daily tasks:")
for taskobject in checklist:
  while True:
    response = input(f"Did you completed the task'{taskobject}'(yes/no)?:").lower()
    if response == 'yes':
      completed_tasks.append(taskobject)
      break
    elif response == 'no':
      incomplete_tasks.append(taskobject)
      break
    else:
      print("Invalid input")

print(" Incompleted_tasks:", incomplete_tasks)
