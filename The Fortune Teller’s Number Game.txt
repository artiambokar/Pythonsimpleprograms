The Fortune Teller’s Number Game:- Objective: Create a number-guessing game.

Level: Easy Imagine you’re helping a fortune teller who claims to know the future but can only hint at numbers. She challenges the user to guess her “magic number”. Whenever a player guesses, she gives a clue: “Too high” or “Too low”. Only those with intuition can guess correctly. Can you code the game and help others test their future-seeing powers? Solution: Use the random module to generate a random number. Use a loop to prompt the user for guesses and provide feedback. Task: The computer randomly selects a number, and the user tries to guess it. Provide feedback such as “Too high” or “Too low”. Continue until the correct number is guessed. Key Concepts: Loops, conditionals, user input, random module.
